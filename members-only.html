            <p>
                Members Only is an Express web app I created to learn user authentication. Members can sign up and verify their status using a secret passcode. Verified members can see names and dates on the message board, while admins can delete posts.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal with this project was to understand how to handle storing sensitive information such as user's passwords,
                keeping track of sessions and providing different information based on a members status.

            <div>
                <p>Passport and Bcyrpt were the main stars in this project. Utilizing Passport's local strategy I was able to verify users' 
                    credentials against the database and allow sessions to persist. <br>Bcrypt made hashing (and salting) passwords straightforward.
                    Storing the encrpyted passwords in a single field was also nice as it meant not having to store salts separately.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Express-Validator was used to validate and sanitise incoming data to make sure the database was receiving the correct information,
                    as well as providing error messages to the user in the event invalid information was provided.
                </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Making sure everything was securely handled was the main point of concern for this project.
                Ensuring EJS templates were insulated from potentially harmful code being injected using validation, sanitisation and escaping code was paramount.
