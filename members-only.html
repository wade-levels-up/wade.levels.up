            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Members Only is an Express application I built when I was learning user-authentication. It allows members to sign up and then verify their membership status if they know a secret passcode.
                <br>Once signed in members have access to a message board, however the names of other members who have posted messages, as well as the date of the post is only visible to verified members. <br>Additionally, members with admin status can delete posts.

                <p>Passport and Bcyrpt were the main stars in this project. Utilizing Passport's local strategy I was able to verify users' 
                    credentials against what was stored in the database and allow sessions to persist, whilst Bcrypt made hashing (and salting) passwords straightforward.
                    Storing the encrpyted passwords in a single table field was also nice as it meant not having to store salts separately.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Express-Validator was used to validate and sanitise incoming data to make sure the database was receiving the correct information,
                    as well as providing error messages to the user in the event the wrong information was provided.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal with this project was to understand how to handle storing sensitive information such as user's passwords,
                keeping track of sessions and providing different information based on a members status.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Making sure everything was securely handled was the main point of concern for this project.
                Ensuring EJS templates were insulated from potentially harmful code being injected using validation, sanitisation and escaping code was paramount.
