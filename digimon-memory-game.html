            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>The Digimon Memory Game is a single page, browser-based game made with React. Players aim to select as many unique Digimon as they can from the cards presented.<br>
              Cards can be reshuffled and a new hand presented to the player. If the same Digimon card is selected twice the score resets to 0. A highscore keeps track of the best score reached.

                Choosing React made the most sense for this project. It handled rendering of the cards when the state changed as well as the score, which saved having to do it from scratch in JavaScript<br>
                Utilizing the useEffect hook to collect data to populate the cards when the app mounted meant this data was readily available for use.<br> 
              </p>

              <p>
                Deploying on Netlify was straightforward. It builds from my Github project respository which made the process much easier than if I'd gone down the route of deploying a React app via Github pages alone.<br>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              This project taught me the value of passing functions as props rather than state. I had challenges with too many renders occuring because
              child elements would receive state that changed (and consequently triggered renders). By passing functions as props that acted on the parent element's score
              rather than the score state itself, the card elements wouldn't need to re-render every time the score changed.
