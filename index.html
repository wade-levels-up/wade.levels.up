      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 33yo living in the heart of Melbourne Australia. In
        my spare time I love learning to code, playing video games, spending
        time with my partner and enjoying a coffee (or two).

        <p>
          For me, life is about pursuing the heights of my creativity, It's about spending my time
          doing the things I love with the people I love.
          I'm a detail-focused person who is also intense, disciplined and driven - but also
          just a big kid once you get to know me.</p>

        <p>Whilst naturally quite introverted, investing time into interpersonal skills
          has helped me develop an ability to network and connect that I can turn on when required.</p>

        <p>Starting late March of 2024 I began teaching myself web development where I'm now learning HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, Node.js, Git, Express and React. Knowing how to code has been an itch I've wanted to scratch
          since I was in my early teens playing around with a program called Game Maker.
          Making games has been a lifelong dream of mine, but I didn't know how to code that young - nor did I have the patience
          or anyone to learn from. Returning to coding at a more mature age with life experience and having achieved other milestones
          has meant I've finally been able to make ground on what I couldn't when I was young - It's an exciting time for me.</p>

        <p>There's a lot to learn, but I feel I've never been in a better position to pursue it.
          I'm excited to see where this journey leads!</p>

          <p>
            This time around I wanted to create a Pokedex-like experience where
            you could see different Pokemon laid out on cards within the
            browser. Each card grabbed information from a publicly available API
