            <p>A file uploader service that allows users to sign-up, login, upload files, download files and view details related to their files. Additionally users can create folders to store their files in.</p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>My mission here was to create a file uploader service similar to Google Drive. Users would be able to create an account and securely upload their files via the browser to a Supabase-based cloud storage bucket.<br />
              Files could then be downloaded or inspected to show their details including file type, date uploaded and file size.

                <li>Supabase</li>

                Supabase was the natural choice for cloud-based file storage. It's signed URLs meant I could add an additional layer of protection when it came to supplying download paths.<br />
                Cloudinary was a runner up. Implementing Supabase was more straightforward and I didn't require the additional image capabilities of Cloudinary.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Passport was important for user authentication, as well as creating and persisting user sessions for up to 30 days. I wanted users to be able to come back and still be logged in for faster access to their files.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              Using cloud-based file storage changed the way I thought about architecting the database.<br />
              Initially I'd hoped I could store files on the database itself. But, it was a paradigm shift to think of the database as only holding meta-data related to the files and not the files themselves! ðŸ¤¯<br />
              <br />
              Additionally, I had a friend run penetration tests on the site. I love it when someone can break my sites! And... break it he did! Which I was thankful for. The tests revealed that user's files could be
              accessed by anyone simply by replacing the file's index number in the URL parameteres... Oops.<br />
              After this I implemented middleware that checks the file ID's against the user's ID to ensure only people who own the files are able to download them.<br />
              This was a great learning experience!
